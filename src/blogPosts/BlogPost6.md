Usage

I commend you for finishing this project. Most people would have accepted errors in their code, or wouldn't have been able to follow the convoluted logic of react-router. This series has emulated many worst case scenarios, all while assuming a best case programmer - you. But you shouldn't have to be this smart or dedicated to write a simple squirrel app. Here is a better way.

Create the same app in react-fp-ts-router in 10 error-free versions
  - Simple Routing Logic
  - add login
  - add mocked data
  - add fetches & error handling & initializers
  - handle parseint url error
  - add Valet
  - add mutable Squirrel state
  - add custom Valet greeting
  - handle 5 sec delay error
  - handle backslash family name error
